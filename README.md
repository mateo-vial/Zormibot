# Zormibot
This is Zormibot, my first big project and first Discord bot.

## Get started
Start by creating a folder called `text_files` and a `token.txt` file inside it. Then paste your bot's token in it. This file is mandatory, or else the bot will not function

In the same folder, create two files called `admin.txt` and `chancmd.txt` containing respectively the discord IDs of the users allowed to perform "dangerous" commands, and the IDs of the channels in which the latter commands can be performed.

If you're lazy, you can create all of those 3 files by running `python createfiles.py`

## Functionalities
The main functionality is a team player list support (originally intended for Mario kart 8 Deluxe) with coutry flags, nickname, first name, twitter, friend code, birthday, phone number and ex teams.
But I also added some more silly functionalities such as auto-replies and fart command.
