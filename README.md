# Zormibot
This is Zormibot, my first big project and first Discord bot.
## Start
At first, create a `token.txt` file inside the repository and paste your bot's token in it.

Also create a `admin.txt` file containing the discord IDs of users who can execute dangerous commands.

## Functionalities
The main functionality is a team player list support (originally intended for Mario kart 8 Deluxe) with coutry flags, nickname, first name, twitter, friend code, birthday, phone number and ex teams.
But I also added some more silly functionalities such as auto-replies and fart command.
